# OverTheWire Natas
OverTheWire Natas walkthrough

After the Bandit adventure, it's time to continue with Natas and web stuff :).

Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

Start here:

Username: natas0
Password: natas0
URL:      http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org

When we log in with the credentials, we get presented with and hint on the page: "You can find the password for the next level on this page.
".
So when we inspect elements we can easily see the password for the next level:
```html
<div id="content">
You can find the password for the next level on this page.

<!--The password for natas1 is 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq -->
</div>
```
